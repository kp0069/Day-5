Scroll Up and Down this page to see the parallax scrolling effect.
This div is just here to enable scrolling.
Tip: Try to remove the background-attachment property to remove the scrolling effect. 
Use a container element and add a background image to the container with a specific height.
Then use the background-attachment: fixed to create the actual parallax effect. 
The other background properties are used to center and scale the image perfectly:
Parallax scrolling is a web site trend where the background content (i.e. an image) is 
moved at a different speed than the foreground content while scrolling.
